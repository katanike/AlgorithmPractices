This project collects algorithm questions from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) and [Nowcoder - Sword of Offer](https://www.nowcoder.com/ta/coding-interviews?page=1). It's like an personal notebook, so please don't waste your time on it. 

However, if you accidentally clicked into one problem, you happened to know Chinese, and get a better solution, pleeeeeease send me an issue. And if you've got some great question to test me, pleeeeeease send me an issue, too ; )
